# Swift has no concept of the S3's resource owner; the resources

# information. This option specifies how the swift3 middleware handles them
# with the S3 API.  If this option is 'false', such kinds of resources will be
# invisible and no users can access them with the S3 API.  If set to 'true',
# the resource without owner is belong to everyone and everyone can access it
# with the S3 API.  If you care about S3 compatibility, set 'false' here.  This
# option makes sense only when the s3_acl option is set to 'true' and your

# If set to 'true', Swift3 uses its own metadata for ACL
# (e.g. X-Container-Sysmeta-Swift3-Acl) to achieve the best S3 compatibility.
# If set to 'false', Swift3 tries to use Swift ACL (e.g. X-Container-Read)
# instead of S3 ACL as far as possible.  If you want to keep backward
# compatibility with Swift3 1.7 or earlier, set false here
# If set to 'false' after set to 'true' and put some container/object,
# all users will be able to access container/object.
# Note that s3_acl doesn't keep the acl consistency between S3 API and Swift
# API. (e.g. when set s3acl to true and PUT acl, we won't get the acl
# information via Swift API at all and the acl won't be applied against to
# Swift API even if it is for a bucket currently supported.)
